This homework requires creating javascript code for a password generator.

## Description

This password generator provides the user with a series of prompts regarding whether or not they would like upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters in a unique password.

- This project tested my ability to use window prompts and a "for loop" incorporating Math functions to generate the random characters for the password.
